      <p class="about__text">Owner / Bread Master, Amilcar Alvarez, immigrated to Portland from Peru in 1979 when he fell in love with an American student traveling abroad. Leaving behind law school in Peru to join his new wife, Amilcar started working from the bottom up at a small Portland french bakery. He excelled at his new job, and began to experiment with sustainable whole grains, an idea that was just beginning to gain popularity, but one he was raised with in the Peruvian countryside.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="about__text">In 1987, Amilcar realized his dream and opened Gabriel’s Bakery, naming it after his new born son. Since then, Amilcar has incorporated baking ideas from his Latino heritage, French training, and even his wife’s Jewish roots.  This blending of traditions have resulted in a unique assortment of delicious breads and pastries.</p>
